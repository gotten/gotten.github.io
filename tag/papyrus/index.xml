      <description>&lt;p&gt;The PAPYRUS project was brought to life by the PhD students supported by Postdocs and staff members at LAM in Marseille. It gathers the expertise and equipment that has been built up over the years to design and construct a state-of-art Pyramid Wavefront Sensor. After installation of the visitor instrument at the 1.52 meter telescope at OHP, first light was obtained in June 2022. During these initial on-sky measurements 15% Strehl was achieved on Vega at a wavelength of 635 nanometer.&lt;/p&gt;
