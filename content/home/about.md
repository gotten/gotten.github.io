# Biography

Astronomer at Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille in France working on the combination of high contract imaging and high dispersion spectroscopy. Involved in the MASCARA project at Leiden Observatory which searches for transiting exoplanets around the brightest stars. PhD on the prototyping, lab-testing and on-sky demonstration of a new type of broad-band coronagraphs. Amateur-genealogist with an interest in genetics as a tool to research family history.
